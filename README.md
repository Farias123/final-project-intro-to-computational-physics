# proof-of-pythagoras-theorem
This program is the final project for my introduction to computational physics classes, and it consists of a demonstration for the Pythagoras Theorem.

The demonstration is made using the size of the squares of the cathetuses and the square of the hypotenuse. There is water on the hypotenuse square and it gets out of it to fill both squares of cathetuses, this way proving that the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the cathetuses.

The documentation is divided into three files:

## index.html
Where it organizes and marks the elements of the page.

## final-project.js
Where the user input is used and the calculus are made, so the objects are drawn, and the water animation happens.

## final-project.css
Where it helps organize the page as well as decorate it.
